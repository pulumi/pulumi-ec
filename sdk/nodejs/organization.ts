/**
 * Manages an Elastic Cloud organization membership.
 *
 *   > **This resource can only be used with Elastic Cloud SaaS**
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Import
 *
 * To import an organization into terraform, first define your organization configuration in your terraform file. For example:
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as ec from "@pulumi/ec";
 *
 * const myorg = new ec.Organization("myorg", {});
 * ```
 *
 * Then import the organization using your organization-id (The organization id can be found on [the organization page](https://cloud.elastic.co/account/members))
 *
 * Now you can run `pulumi preview` to see if there are any diffs between your config and how your organization is currently configured.
 *
 * ### Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as ec from "@pulumi/ec";
 *
 * const myOrg = new ec.Organization("my_org", {members: {
 *     "a.member@example.com": {
 *         organizationRole: "billing-admin",
 *         deploymentRoles: [
 *             {
 *                 role: "editor",
 *                 allDeployments: true,
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 role: "editor",
 *                 deploymentIds: ["ce03a623751b4fc98d48400fec58b9c0"],
 *             },
 *         ],
 *         projectElasticsearchRoles: [
 *             {
 *                 role: "admin",
 *                 allProjects: true,
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 role: "admin",
 *                 projectIds: ["c866244b611442d585e23a0cc8c9434c"],
 *             },
 *         ],
 *         projectObservabilityRoles: [],
 *         projectSecurityRoles: [],
 *     },
 * }});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Use variables to give the same roles to multiple users
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as ec from "@pulumi/ec";
 *
 * const deploymentAdmin = {
 *     deploymentRoles: [{
 *         role: "admin",
 *         allDeployments: true,
 *     }],
 * };
 * const deploymentViewer = {
 *     deploymentRoles: [{
 *         role: "viewer",
 *         allDeployments: true,
 *     }],
 * };
 * const myOrg = new ec.Organization("my_org", {members: {
 *     "admin@example.com": deploymentAdmin,
 *     "viewer@example.com": deploymentViewer,
 *     "another.viewer@example.com": deploymentViewer,
 * }});
 * ```
